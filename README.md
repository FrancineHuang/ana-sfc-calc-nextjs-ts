# SFC Calculator for ANA Mileage Members - NextJS & TypeScript

## 🌐 Project

SFC Calculator is a simple front-end web application designed to maintain a list of their flights and calculate the premium points, simulating the member status, allowing users to add, edit, and delete flight data. The app is built using only front-end technologies (temporally no backend database). The application relies on the use of redux and local
storage to persist the user data.
